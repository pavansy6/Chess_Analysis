# Chess Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Chess.ipynb`) that performs data analysis on a chess game dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover insights from chess game records.

## Overview

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

- The chess dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
- Initial data cleaning, such as handling missing values and filtering relevant columns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Top Opening Moves:** Analysis of the most common opening moves in the dataset.
- **Game Outcomes by Opening:** Examines how different opening moves correlate with game outcomes (win/loss/draw).
- **Player Performance:** Evaluation of player performance metrics such as win percentage.

### 3. Data Visualization

- **Win Percentage by Top Players:** Visual representation of the top 10 players by win percentage.
- **Opening Move Analysis:** Bar plots and other visualizations to understand the impact of opening moves on game outcomes.

### 4. Conclusion

- Summarizes the key insights derived from the analysis, such as the influence of specific opening moves on the likelihood of winning a game.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
